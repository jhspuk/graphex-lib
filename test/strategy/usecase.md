# Desired behaviour
## Introduction
The GraphEx library is a suite of tools available to import, run, modify and analyse executable graph networks. It was first designed around Petrinet style networks, however has been rearchitected to be agnostic of any one style. Digital or analogue. Its interface is by c++ class functions, having built a directory of available executable parts. One powerful idea behind GraphEx is its search and replace functionality, using substitutions to match new parts to old parts, and search functionality that can locate elements uniquely with its searchspace not limited to labels, for example intersecting associativity. With a region based strategy, multithreading is possible and highly efficient.

## Behavioural guarantees
- Intake of file to specify nodes and connections in memory
- Simulation of memory model
- Get and Set functionality inside memory model
- Unified search proceedure for oversight, compiling, linking and analysis
- Of each node, structure of payload can be respecified for different usecases
